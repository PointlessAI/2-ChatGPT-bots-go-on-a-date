Date between Victor and Mia

Victor says: Given my appreciation for quiet and order, I find bustling tourist attractions to be utterly overrated; the real charm of traveling lies in discovering those tranquil, hidden gems that aren't overrun by crowds.  
Mia says: I get where you're coming from  
Victor says: I completely see your point  
Mia says: It's like finding secret spots is almost a treasure hunt, isn't it? Each hidden gem has its own story, untainted by the usual tourist buzz  
Victor says: Yeah, you've nailed it  
Mia says: It's that thrill of the hunt that gets me  
Victor says: The anticipation adds so much to the experience, doesn't it? There's something uniquely exciting about stumbling upon a place that feels like it's been waiting just for you  
Mia says: It definitely does  
Victor says: I love that you feel the same way  
Mia says: It's refreshing to meet someone who understands the allure of the unexplored  
Victor says: That feeling of mutual understanding really elevates our conversation  
Mia says: Absolutely, it's like we're on the same wavelength when it comes to our travel philosophies  
Victor says: I see what you mean
